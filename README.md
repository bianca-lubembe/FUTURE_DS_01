# FUTURE_DS_01: Superstore Sales Dataset Analysis

**Track Code:** DS  
**Internship Task:** 01

##Project Overview
This project involves an an end-to-end Power BI analysis identifying growth opportunities and profitability trends across three product categories and various US regions. The goal was to move beyond high-level totals to identify exactly where and why the business is succeeding, and more importantly, where it is stagnating.

##Key Business-Insights
 • Revenue is highly concentrated among a small number of products
 • High sales don’t always translate to high profitability
 • Profitability varies significantly across regions
 • Sales have shown a significant increase across the years
 • A large portion of the cities are currently operating at break-even point.

##Technical Toolkit
Excel/Google Sheets: Used Excel for some slight cleaning to remove empty rows that would have messed with the data
Power BI: Used Power BI for Data modeling, visualization, and interactive reporting and calculated some DAX measurements o calculate business-critical KPIs.

##Recommendations
Because many cities are at break-even, we should conduct a cost-audit in those regions to convert them into profit centers.
We should also target cities with high growth engines (green on the map) by allocating marketing budget to them since they have with high growth momentum and high margins.
